## Sentience Format
 `as opposed to sapient format`

- aiModules: {array}  //  array of potential specialist modules: [ai-contemporary-music,ai-garbage-collection,etc.]; presume from some ecosystem source like npm, code that is runnable from a git repo inside the HRP ecosystem
- commands: wake(), sleep(), clone() [similar to VM]
- format/form-factor: {string} human/opera/etc  //  what format the aiModules inhabit, format having a pre-defined set of senses and events?
  - events?
  - senses?
  - perceptions?
  - life cycle? //  we might logically need to build death into their equation so that they could give us consensual eternity -- i.e., *I* take your consciousness-space, AI
